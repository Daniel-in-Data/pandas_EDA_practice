# Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas
### Practice Notebook
<br>


## Overview

This notebook is a short practice exercise focused on improving data exploration and manipulation skills using Python and Pandas.
The goal is to perform step-by-step Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sample dataset — including inspection, cleaning, summary statistics, and visual exploration.

<br>



### Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
<br>


### Learning Objectives

Load, inspect, and summarize a dataset with Pandas.
Handle missing values and detect duplicates.
Explore distributions and correlations.
Practice feature understanding before modeling.
Generate clean, readable outputs for documentation.

<br>


### Notebook Contents

Section	Description
1. Data Loading	Import dataset, check structure and types.
2. Data Cleaning	Handle nulls, rename columns, remove duplicates.
3. Descriptive Statistics	Compute mean, median, variance, correlations.
4. Visual Exploration	Histograms, pairplots, boxplots, heatmaps.
5. Insights Summary	Record observations and next steps.
<br>


### Key Takeaways

Practiced systematic EDA workflow from import to insights.
Strengthened proficiency in Pandas operations and visualization.
Reinforced the habit of documenting analysis clearly in Jupyter notebooks.
